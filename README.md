## Messages

Messages are generated using the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating engine. 

A message template for each event must be located inside the `templates` directory with the following naming syntax: `{Event}.txt`.

Default templates are provided for some events as described in the [Events](#events) section. Each of them can be customized (or new ones added) to your liking by following the Jinja's [Template Designer Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/).


## Running

1. Create systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/embyhooks.service`
    ```service
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/embyhooks.service
    ```

    Replace `/full/path/to/` with full path to `emby-webhooks` cloned repository and `root` to user which runs the service (if appropriate). Then, after saving the file, you need to reload systemd's daemons: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`. 
    
    The content of the file is:
    ```conf
    [Unit]
    Description=Emby webhooks
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=root
    Group=root
    WorkingDirectory=/full/path/to/emby-webhooks/
    ExecStart=/full/path/to/emby-webhooks/venv/bin/gunicorn run:app -b 0.0.0.0:64921
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    This will run the service available on your local network with device's local IP address and port `64921`. If you want to have the service available only on the device (localhost) you should change `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`. To switch to another port replace `64921` with whichever port number you want (just make sure it is available).

2. Enable service start on system boot
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable embyhooks.service
    ```

3. Using the service
    - `sudo systemctl status embyhooks.service` - show service status
    - `sudo systemctl start embyhooks.service` - start the service
    - `sudo systemctl stop embyhooks.service` - stop the service
